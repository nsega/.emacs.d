`window-size-change-functions` only fires when a window is actually resized, unlike `window-configuration-change-hook` which fires on nearly any layout change.

**Summary of changes made:**

| Issue | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal title | `buffer-list-update-hook` (fires constantly) | `run-with-idle-timer 1` (at most once/sec when idle) |
| Frame title (GUI) | `(:eval ...)` on every redraw | Cached, updated by idle timer |
| vterm width | `window-configuration-change-hook` | `window-size-change-functions` |
