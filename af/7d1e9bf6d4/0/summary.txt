Done. A few notes on the reasoning:

- `tree-sitter/` holds compiled grammar binaries (`.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS) downloaded by `M-x treesit-install-language-grammar`. These are platform-specific and regenerated on demand, so there's no value tracking them.
- They can also be quite large and would bloat the repo history.
- Any collaborator (or future you on a different machine) will just run `treesit-install-language-grammar` to rebuild them for their platform.

The `custom.backup.*/` and `init.el.backup.*` files are still untracked — you may want to decide whether to add those to `.gitignore` as well, or delete them if they're no longer needed.
